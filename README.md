# pawnsOnlyMt
This is an adaption of the game PawnsOnlyChess from the Jetbrains Academy - it can actually play a decent game given enough time to "think".  Still under development
The code is built using some  https://github.com/ratosh/pirarucu.git base- but basics are mine. Uses a alpha beta seach that needs further development.

The goals of the project are to use a deep learning network for position analysis replacing the current evaluation and search.
