# Pawns Only Chess
This is an adaption of the game Pawns Only Chess from the Jetbrains Academy project but adapted to play the game - it can actually play a decent game given enough time to "think".  Still under development
The code is built using some  https://github.com/ratosh/pirarucu.git base. Uses a alpha beta seach that needs further development.

The goals of the project is to use a deep learning network for position analysis, replacing the current evaluation and search.
